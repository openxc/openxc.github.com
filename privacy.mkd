DART, Omniture tags, DoubleClick, Efficient Frontier, and Google Analytics) to

### 7. Methods to Collect Information:

A "cookie" is a small text file that helps us in many ways to make your visit to
our website more enjoyable and meaningful to you. For example, cookies avoid you
having to log in every time you come back to one of our websites. They also
allow us to tailor a website or advertisement to better match your interests and
preferences. There are a couple different types of cookies.

A "session" cookie is stored only in your computer's working memory (RAM) and
only lasts for your browsing session. When you close all your browser's windows,
or when you shut down your computer, the session cookie disappears forever.

A "persistent" cookie is stored on your computer's hard drive until a specified
date, which could be tomorrow, next week, or 10 years from now. Persistent
cookies stay on your computer until either a) they expire, b) they are
overwritten with newer cookies, or c) you manually remove them. Most browsers
can be configured not to accept cookies, however, this may prevent you from
having access to some site functions or features.

This site may use third-party click tracking analytics tools (such as DART,
Omniture tags, DoubleClick, Efficient Frontier, and Google Analytics) to capture
clickthrough statistics.

openxcplatform.com may use spotlight ads/web beacons/GIF/pixel tags which are
site instrumentation tools that help us to determine, for instance, whether a
page has been viewed or not and, if so, how many times. Emails or electronic
newsletters we send may use tools (e.g., pixel tags or web beacons) to gather
email metrics and information to improve the reader's experience such as how
many of the emails are opened, if they were printed or forwarded, the type of
device (e.g., mobile or PC) from which they were opened, and the city, state,
and county associated with the applicable IP address. In general, any electronic
image viewed as part of a webpage, including an ad banner, can act as a web
beacon. When you visit our website the server housing the pages automatically
generates a "session log."  We use session logs to help us determine how people
travel through our site. In this way, we can structure our pages so that the
information most frequently visited is easier to find. By tracking page visits,
we can also determine if the information we're providing is being used. The only
data gathered is the Internet Protocol (IP) address from which you came (which
contains no personal information), the website that referred you, the pages you
visited and the date and time of those visits
