    <h1>Android Host Device</h1>
</div>

OpenXC applications on Android are merely Android applications that use the
OpenXC Android library to receive and parse data from a vehicle interface.
Android is one of a few [options for writing
applications](/host-devices/hardware.html) using OpenXC.

    <h3>Bluetooth</h3>
</div>

A Bluetooth vehicle interface is the most widely supported by Android devices,
so it is the recommended interface.

The OpenXC Enabler application handles the actual communication to the
Vehicle Interface. You don't need to add any extra code to your application
to communicate via Bluetooth.

When using a Bluetooth-equipped vehicle interface, the Android host
device must run **Android 2.2** or greater (i.e. API level 8).

    <h3>USB OTG Cable</h3>
</div>
Alternatively, if you wish to hard-wire to the vehicle interface with a USB
connection, the Android host device must:

* Run **Android 3.0** or greater (i.e. API level 12) if you plan to
  use the standard USB vehicle interface.
* Support **USB host mode** or **USB OTG** - Some tablets offer a full-size USB
  port and others are compatible with USB OTG adapters.
  that attach to the micro-USB port normally used for charging.
