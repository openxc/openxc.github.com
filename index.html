            <h1>The OpenXC Platform</h1>
            <p>
                OpenXC&trade; is a combination of open source hardware and software that
                lets you extend your vehicle with custom applications and
                pluggable modules. It uses standard, well-known tools to open up
                a wealth of data from the vehicle to developers.

				<h2>What is OpenXC?</h2>
				<p>
					OpenXC is an API to your car - by installing a small hardware
					module - the vehicle data becomes accessible from most Android
					applications using the OpenXC library.

		 		<h2>Unlocking the Power of Data</h2> 
				<p>
					OpenXC allows consumer devices, such as smart phones, to access
					data from a vehicle. Using OpenXC, you can monitor many of the 
					sensors on a vehicle, enabling new and innovative vehicle-centric
					applications.

                <h2>What is OpenXC?</h2>
                <p>
                    OpenXC is an API to your car - by installing a small
                    hardware module to read and translate metrics from a car's
                    internal network, the data becomes accessible from most
                    Android applications using the OpenXC library. You can start
                    making vehicle-aware applications that have better
                    interfaces based on context, can minimize distraction while
                    driving, are integrated with other connected services, and
                    can offer you more insight into your car's operation.

                    Researchers at Ford Motor Company joined up to create a
                    standard way of creating aftermarket software and hardware
                    for vehicles. Every new car is full of computers and
                    electronics, and there is growing interest in connecting the
                    output from those systems to third-party applications and
                    the web. Many companies are already offering tools to hook
                    into the driver's interface, but for the most part they have
                    limited availability for hobbyists and developers. What if
                    the system was designed from the ground up to be open source
                    and to give insight into the vehicle itself? With proper
                    hardware isolation to ensure you can't "brick" your $20,000
                    investment in a car, OpenXC imagines when your car is as
                    easy to program as your smartphone.

                <p>
                    OpenXC uses an

                    (similar to an <a href="http://arduino.cc">Arduino</a>) to
                    pull data from the car, and has official support for writing
                    applications for <a href="/android/index.html">Android</a>

                <h2>OpenXC Workshop at TechShop</h2>

                <p>Ford's Research and Advanced Engineering team is on tour!
                    This year, we will be hosting a hands-on OpenXC workshop at
                    every <a href="http://techshop.ws/">TechShop</a> in the
                    United States. At the workshop you can learn how to build
                    vehicle data into Android applications, test with live
                    vehicle data from a Ford vehicle, and build (and take home!)

                <h2>Personalized Fuel Efficiency Challenge</h2>

                <p>
                    On March 27th, Ford launched a <a
                            href="http://ford.challengepost.com/">challenge</a>
                    to engage the developer community in creating innovative
                    apps on top of the OpenXC platform with the
                    goal of helping drivers better understand and improve their
                    personal fuel efficiency.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Don't miss the new <a
                            href="https://github.com/openxc/trace-analyzer">open
                        source</a> <a
                                href="http://trace-analyzer.openxcplatform.com">web-based
                            visualizer</a> for OpenXC vehicle data, too.
                </p>

                <h2>What can it do?</h2>

                <p>
                    Plug the OpenXC vehicle interface into your car and from
                    Android, you can read data from the vehicle in real-time
                    like the steering wheel angle, GPS position, and vehicle
                    speed. Right now, OpenXC supports over a dozen different
                    measurements on a growing list of Ford vehicles.
                </p>

                <p>
                    A simple start is to take advantage of the GPS antenna on
                    the roof of the car to improve the accuracy of your location
                    aware application. Or get creative - why not generate a
                    digital painting based on your steering wheel movements over
                    the course of a day, and upload it directly to the web? No
                    single company can think of all possibilities for
                    applications, and that's why OpenXC gives the freedom of
                    experimentation to developers.
                </p>

                <h2>How can I write OpenXC applications?</h2>

                <p>
                    You can get started right away without any hardware - check out
                    the <a href="/getting-started/index.html">tutorial</a> to
                    begin. When you're ready to test
                    in a vehicle you'll need to buy or build the
                    <a href="/vehicle-interface/index.html">vehicle interface</a>
                    and make sure you have a compatible
