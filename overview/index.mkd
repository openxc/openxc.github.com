    <h1>About</h1>
</div>

OpenXC is a combination of open source hardware and software that lets you
extend your vehicle with custom applications and pluggable modules. It uses
standard, well-known tools to open up a wealth of data from the vehicle to
developers.

Vehicles are indisputably becoming more and more connected, but until now the
consumer hasn't had much control over the exact capabilities of their car. Very
few infotainment systems are user upgradable, and thanks to the extremely fast
pace of consumer electronics and the Web (especially when compared to the long
development cycles in the automotive industry) next-gen can quickly become
last-gen. This applies to both hardware and software - for example, the 2G radio
in the first iPhone was quickly upgraded in the next model, but a vehicle from
2007 with an embedded modem would likely be stuck with it for the life of the
vehicle. The average lifespan of a vehicle today is 13 years; a smartphone is 6
to 9 months.

<div class="page-header">
    <h3>Guiding Principles</h3>
</div>

What if the user-facing hardware and software was independent from any one
vehicle, and could be purchased and installed by consumers as an aftermarket
add-on? What if the infotainment hardware was more modular and user-upgradable,
and perhaps most importantly, transferable from one vehicle to another?
Consumers have already taken this approach to some degree by using their
smartphones as the primary navigation, media and communications hub. However,
the known dangers of using a handheld device while driving necessitate better
vehicle integration to provide safer, more context aware interfaces.

<div class="page-header">
    <h3>Customer Experience</h3>
</div>

OpenXC completely changes the customer experience with in-vehicle technology.
Consider if every new vehicle included a built-in base board at no cost to the
customer. This base board has connections to the dashboard interface and audio
system and a [vehicle interface](/vehicle-interface/index.html) - we
would consider this OpenXC-compatible. The consumer has the option of making the
vehicle OpenXC-enabled by adding a ~$40 module that includes the host device
where OpenXC applications actually run. Other modules that add hardware features
can be purchased separately and plugged into the base board like any USB device.

Don't need Bluetooth? Don't buy the Bluetooth module. Want a 3G connection? Buy
a 3G USB adapter from your preferred wireless provider. 4G just came out? Buy a
new adapter and swap it in.

Older vehicles can also benefit from this approach by using an aftermarket base
board. The same host device and modules can be used in a car from 2002 as long
as a standard interface to the vehicle's subsystems is exposed to applications.
The portability also benefits those in rental cars, car sharing programs and
customers of short-term rentals like ZipCar. Consumers might even own an OpenXC
system without owning a vehicle.

<div class="page-header">
    <h3>Developer Experience</h3>
</div>

OpenXC opens up a previously opaque environment to an entirely new class of
developers, who will bring more ideas and solutions to the table than any one
company or industry consortium could dream up. The ideal method of distribution
for applications isn't clear yet, but it could range from a "walled garden" app
market (a la iTunes) to pre-loaded USB flash drives sold at drugstore checkout
counters.

If you have a project of your own, fork the [openxc.github.com][] project on GitHub
(that's this site!), add a new page for your project with links to the code and
hardware schematics (if you have them) and send a pull request. We will include
as many well documented, functional projects as we can.

### Boing Boing Data Driven Hackathon Projects
Data Driven was a hackathon organized around OpenXC as part of Boing
Boing's
<a href="http://boingboing.net/tag/ingenuity">Ingenuity</a> event.
Check out some of the great projects that came out of the hackathon
below:

* [OpenXC Van-Go](http://boingboing.net/2013/09/03/car-tells-robot-artist-what-to.html): This team used [Super-Awesome Sylvia's](http://sylviashow.com/) [WaterColorBo    t](http://watercolorbot.com/).
  to paint pictures based on live OpenXC data.  TechNinja explains
  more <a

  Joe Grand gives us a vehicle tour in this <a
  href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZedQH9FHiw">video</a>.
* [Autobahn](http://boingboing.net/2013/09/04/car-composes-kraftwerkian-musi.html):
  Using real-time data gathered from OpenXC, Autobahn synthesizes the
  data into a MIDI [musical composition](https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=dj-LJQyGjls#t=39).
* [Smart Brake Light](http://ledpixelart.com/portfolio-item/smart-brake-light-prototype-2/)
  Al began this hack at Data Driven and expanded on it at the Ford
  Electrified Vehicle Hackathon.  Using his existing PIXEL hardware
  device with 32x32 RGB LEDs, he introduced functionality that would
  warn drivers of sudden stops.  At the Electrified Vehicle
  Hackathon, Al's team added voice triggering and functionality to
  thank a fellow driver for something.  See the
  [demo](http://ledpixelart.com/portfolio-item/smart-brake-light-prototype-2/) here.
