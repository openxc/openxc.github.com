There is a [public wiki at

game for here, but please keep discussion on the mailing list.

### Proprietary Vehicle Interface Firmware

Unless you are implementing custom CAN messages, you will most likely need a
[pre-built OpenXC binary](/vehicle-interface/firmware.html) from the
manufacturer of your vehicle. Each OEM can decide whether or not to participate
in OpenXC and if so, which types of data they wish to expose.

and always will be remain free.
