<h2>Step-By-Step Guide to Developing with OpenXC</h2>
</div>

Follow this step-by-step guide to ensure you've covered all your bases while
developing your OpenXC
application.

<ol>
    <li><a href="/getting-started/preparing-workstation.html">Set up and configure your Workstation</a></li>

    <li>Develop your first OpenXC Android Application
        <ul>
            <li><a href="/android/library-installation.html#enabler">Install the
                Enabler App</a></li>
            <li><a href="/android/tutorial.html">Walk through the App
                Tutorial</a></li>
            <li><a href="/android/testing.html">Test your application</a></li>
        </ul>
    </li>

    <li>Set up and configure your Vehicle Interface
        <ul>
            <li><a href="/vehicle-interface/hardware.html">Obtain or build a
                Vehicle Interface</a></li>
            <li><a href="/vehicle-interface/firmware.html">Flash
                Firmware</a></li>
            <li><a href="/python/getting-started.html">Use Python to test your
                Vehicle Interface</a></li>
        </ul>
    </li>

    <li>Test the full system in the car
        <ul>
            <li>Plug the Vehicle Interface into your vehicles OBDII port.</li>
            <li>Connect the Vehicle Interface to your Android device
                <ul>
                    <li>Using USB:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Connect the Vehicle Interface's micro-usb port
                            to the Android device using an OTG (On the Go)
                            cable.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Using Bluetooth:
                        <ul><strong>First Session</strong>
                            <li>On your Android device, go to
                                Settings->Bluetooth and turn Bluetooth on.</li>
                            <li>Scan for devices, and click on OpenXC to pair
                                your device with the Vehicle Interface.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <ul><strong>Subsequent Sessions</strong>
                            <li>Bluetooth should pair automatically when your
                                application is opened.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul></li>
            <li>Open the <a href="/getting-started/library-installation.html#enabler">Enabler
                app</a>, then use the Home button on your Android device to leave
                the activity.</li>
            <li>Run your application.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>

</ol>

If everything goes well, your app should now be streaming data from your car
through the Vehicle Interface.

If something goes wrong, ensure that you didn't miss an earlier step. Go back
and test your application and Vehicle Interface using the various testing tools
to try and narrow down the problem. If all else fails, or if you can't find a
solution to your problem, check for similar issues in the [Google
Group](groups.google.com/group/openxc). If you can't find a similar issue,
create a new post to get some assistance.

<h2>Next Steps</h2>

When you're ready to begin writing an OpenXC app, continue on to
[set up your Dev Environment](/getting-started/library-installation.html). You
can get started even if you don't have a hardware vehicle interface (or even a
car!).
