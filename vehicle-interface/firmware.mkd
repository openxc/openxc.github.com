    <h2>Updating with a .hex File</h2>
</div>

Updates to the CAN translator firmware may be distributed as pre-compiled
binaries, e.g. if they are distributed by an OEM who does not wish to make the
CAN signals public. If that's the case for your vehicle, you will have a `.hex`
file and can use the [upload_hex.sh][] script to update your device.

The firmware for all supported Ford vehicles is currently available to anyone
who signs this [developer agreement](/agreement.html).

The instructions for re-programming a CAN translator are in the [CAN translator
documentation](http://openxcplatform.com/cantranslator/installation/binary.html).

<div class="page-header">
    <h2>Custom CAN Signal Definition</h2>
</div>

Developers that know the details of the CAN bus they will be using can choose to
implement their own signal definitions for the translator. The process is
described in the [CAN translator
documentation](http://openxcplatform.com/cantranslator/installation/installation.html).

<h2>Next Steps</h2>

You're now ready to [test your CAN translator in a vehicle][testing].
