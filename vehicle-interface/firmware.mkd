    <h1>Vehicle Interface Firmware</h1>
</div>

Before you can use a vehicle interface (VI), it has to be programmed with a
firmware that understands data sent by your car. You have a few options:

**On-board Diagnostics (OBD-II) Data from CAN**

To read *standard OBD-II diagnostics data from a CAN bus*, use the open source
OBD-II OpenXC firmware. You can download the latest compiled  version of that
firmware from the [vi-firmware releases
page](https://github.com/openxc/vi-firmware/releases){:target="_blank"}. The OBD-II build will
output a [subset of OBD-II
data](https://github.com/openxc/vi-firmware/blob/next/src/obd2.cpp#L41){:target="_blank"} that
your car supports over USB and Bluetooth just like normal OpenXC data. Note that
it's not much data - most likely only RPM, vehicle speed and intake manifold
pressure. Your car must also support OBD-II via CAN, which is only required
since 2008. Otherwise, you've reached the limits of the federal standard - call
your congressman if you want more!

**Emulated Data**

If you don't have access to a car and you want to verify the connection to the
VI from your host device (or it's winter in Michigan and you'd just rather stay
inside), you can use a simple emulator firmware. The emulator firmware will be a part of the firmware zip file that you will find on the [vi-firmware release
page](https://github.com/openxc/vi-firmware/releases){:target="_blank"}. It generates
fake vehicle data and continuously sends it over USB and Bluetooth as if it were
live data. It's completely random data, so don't try and build an app against
it.

**Expanded Proprietary Data**

To read expanded data from a particular car, look for firmware distributed as
pre-compiled binaries by your car's manufacturer. Check the [list of supported
vehicles](/hardware/vehicles.html) for your car's make and model and for links
to download the firmware.

**Flash the Firmware**

If you have a Ford Reference VI, then follow these [instructions](http://vi.openxcplatform.com/firmware/programming/usb.html) to upload the firmware. For other versions of VIs, look up the instructions for uploading the
firmware to your VI on the [supported VI hardware
page](/vehicle-interface/hardware.html)
- it's different for each.
