This page serves as a home for example projects built on the OpenXC platform. If
you have a project of your own, fork the [openxc.github.com][]{:target="_blank"} project on GitHub
(that's this site!), add a new page for your project with links to the code and
hardware schematics (if you have them) and send a pull request. We will include
as many well documented, functional projects as we can.

Don't miss the creative projects from [OpenXC hackathons and other
events](/community/events.html), too.

## Research Projects

* MSU Biometrics - Sample mobility applications using fingerprint scanner on your Android device. 
  There are two sample applications: family car sharing and a dynamic shuttle.

    * [My Car](https://github.com/Keyurpatel93/MyCar){:target="_blank"} - This prototype application is developed 
      to emulate car setting personalization based on user authentication on a smartphone.
    * [Car State](https://github.com/Keyurpatel93/CarState){:target="_blank"} - A complementary application for the 
      MyCar application to show current car settings, and settings after a user has been authenticated.

    * [Dynamic Shuttle Ride](https://github.com/Keyurpatel93/DynamicShuttleRide){:target="_blank"} - The Dynamic Shuttle Ride 
      app is an android application that was developed to emulate an on demand shuttle service app to prototype 
      new features and functionality.
    * [Dynamic Shuttle](https://github.com/Keyurpatel93/DynamicShuttle){:target="_blank"} - The DynamicShuttle application 
      emulates a QR scanner that would be used on a shuttle to scan the boarding pass of the passengers.  
  
  The links above to the GitHub repositories provide further details.
  
* [WIMXWAYNE](http://groups.geni.net/geni/wiki/WIMXWAYNE){:target="_blank"} - WiMAX Prototyping in
  Metro Detroit: Integrating GENI Engineering with Wireless Network Applications
  and Science.

* [Stanford Senior Design Project, 2013](/projects/stanford-me113-spring-2013) - A senior capstone design 
  project of four Stanford Mechanical Engineering Candidates during Spring 2013
    * [Shape Retaining Mount](/projects/stanford-me113-spring-2013/shape-retaining-mount.html)
    * [3D Printed Tablet Mount](/projects/stanford-me113-spring-2013/3d-printed-tablet-mount.html)
    * [Smartphone User Interface Cloning](/projects/stanford-me113-spring-2013/smartphone-user-interface-cloning.html)
