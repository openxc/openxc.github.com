    <h1>OpenXC Data Set</h1>
</div>

This is the list of signals officially supported by the Android library. All
vehicles do not necessarily support all of these signals - there are plans to be
able to check for the existence of a signal before using it. For information on
which data is supported on your vehicle, see the [supported
vehicles](/hardware/vehicles.html) page.

The OpenXC message format is officially documented and versioned in a [separate
repository](https://github.com/openxc/openxc-message-format) - this page as an
unofficial mirror.
