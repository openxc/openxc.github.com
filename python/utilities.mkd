The `openxc-dashboard` tool available as a part of the [OpenXC Python
library][python-lib] can be used to view the output of the vehicle interface
over USB or UART. This is the most useful tool when determining which vehicle
signals are working.

The Python library can be installed with `pip`:

{% highlight sh %}
$ pip install openxc
{% endhighlight %}

Once installed, you can use any of the [tools it provides][python-lib].

{% highlight sh %}
# Show a dashboard summary of the current values
$ openxc-dashboard
...

# Show a real-time stream of all messages
$ openxc-dump
...

# Send an OBD-II diagnostic request
$ openxc-diag --message 0x7df --mode 0x3
...
{% endhighlight %}

It may also be necessary to check the current version of the software you have
on a vehicle interface - the `openxc-control` tool can tell you that.

{% highlight sh %}
$ openxc-control version
Device is running version 1.1
{% endhighlight %}

You can also write a message back to the vehicle interface (which may or may not
write it through to the CAN bus, depending on if it is an approved signal or
not):

{% highlight sh %}
$ openxc-control write --name steering_wheel_angle --value 42.0
{% endhighlight %}

You can write raw CAN messages, too:

{% highlight sh %}
$ openxc-control write --bus 1 --id 42 --data 0x1234
{% endhighlight %}
